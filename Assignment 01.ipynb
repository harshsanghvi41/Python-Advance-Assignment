    "Q1. What is the purpose of Python&#39;s OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans: The first argument of every class method, including init, is always a reference to the current instance of the class. By convention, this argument is always named self. In the init method, self refers to the newly created object; in other class methods, it refers to the instance whose method was called"
